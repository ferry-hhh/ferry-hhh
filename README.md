## Hi there 👋

### Hi, I'm Yanjing Wang

🎓 I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Technology at [NUDT](https://www.nudt.edu.cn/). 

🧑‍🏫 I am advised by Prof. [Nong Xiao](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/Xiaonong) and Dr. [Lizhou Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=phujDnIAAAAJ).

🔭 My current research interests focus on _coherent heterogeneous computing_ and _disaggregated memory systems_.

🏛️ Before my doctoral studies, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [CQU](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/).
